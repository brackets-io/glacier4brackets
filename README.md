Glacier theme for Brackets

This theme is totally based on one of coolest themes I've encountered,
and that is [Glacier theme for Sublime Text](https://github.com/shovelandsandbox/glacier-theme)

##  How to Use
1. Open Brackets.
2. Open the `Extension Manager`.
3. Switch to `Themes` tab.
4. Search for `Glacier`.
5. Click `Install`.
6. `View` -> `Themes...` -> `Glacier`.
7. Enjoy! :)

##Notes

1. Comment color is changed to purple so it is more visible. That was on purpose.
2. Fonts are added - one you see on screenshot is premium font called Congenial Light.
   `    font-family: Congenial Light, Neris Thin, Neue Kabel, Titillium, Exo, Menlo, Monospace, sans-serif;` 
   It will automatically drop to Titillium - which is free, and you should install it, if you don't have any 
   of premium fonts.
3. Thank God for less and [lesstester](https://lesstester.com) and Brackets editor itself. Without it this wouldn't be possible
4. See error, or something u'd like to fix? Send PR or write in issues
